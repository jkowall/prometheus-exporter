# Spacelift Prometheus Exporter

This repository contains a Prometheus exporter for exporting metrics from your Spacelift account.

![Dashboard Example](dashboard-example.png)

## Quick Start

The Spacelift exporter is provided as a statically linked Go binary and a Docker container. You can
find the latest release [here](https://github.com/spacelift-io/prometheus-exporter/releases/latest).
The Docker container is available from our public container registry:
`public.ecr.aws/spacelift/promex`.

### Authentication

The exporter uses
[Spacelift API keys](https://docs.spacelift.io/integrations/api#spacelift-api-key-greater-than-token)
to authenticate, and also needs to know your Spacelift account API endpoint. Your API endpoint is in
the format `https://<account>.app.spacelift.io`, for example `https://my-account.app.spacelift.io`.

**NOTE:** on current Spacelift SaaS any API key works, provided it can read the root space (the
`usage` field requires it). Self-Hosted releases older than August 2026 restrict `publicWorkerPool`,
`usage` and `metrics` to non-machine keys; on such a release, run the exporter with an admin user's
key or with `--partial-scrapes`, which serves the private worker pool metrics and reports the
restricted collectors as unsupported (see below).

#### OIDC API keys with rotating secrets

If your API key is configured for OIDC (the key ID has the form `oidc::<issuer>::<key-id>`), the
"secret" is an OIDC JWT issued by your identity provider rather than a static string. Use
`--api-key-secret-file` (or `SPACELIFT_PROMEX_API_KEY_SECRET_FILE`) to point at the file that holds
the token. The file is re-read on every token refresh, so projected Kubernetes service-account
tokens that rotate on disk are picked up automatically without restarting the exporter.

### Running via the Binary

Download the exporter binary from our
[releases](https://github.com/spacelift-io/prometheus-exporter/releases/latest) page, make sure it's
added to your PATH, and then use the `spacelift-promex serve` command to run the exporter binary:

```shell
spacelift-promex serve --api-endpoint "https://<account>.app.spacelift.io" --api-key-id "<API Key ID>" --api-key-secret "<API Key Secret>"
```

### Running via Docker

Use the following command to run the exporter via Docker:

```shell
docker run -it --rm -p 9953:9953 -e "SPACELIFT_PROMEX_API_ENDPOINT=https://<account>.app.spacelift.io" \
  -e "SPACELIFT_PROMEX_API_KEY_ID=<API Key ID>" \
  -e "SPACELIFT_PROMEX_API_KEY_SECRET=<API Key Secret>" \
  public.ecr.aws/spacelift/promex
```

### Running in Kubernetes

You can use the following Deployment definition to run the exporter:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: spacelift-promex
  labels:
    app: spacelift-promex
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: spacelift-promex
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: spacelift-promex
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: spacelift-promex
          image: public.ecr.aws/spacelift/promex:latest
          ports:
            - name: metrics
              containerPort: 9953
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health
              port: metrics
            periodSeconds: 5
          env:
            - name: "SPACELIFT_PROMEX_API_ENDPOINT"
              value: "" # Add your endpoint here
            - name: "SPACELIFT_PROMEX_API_KEY_ID"
              value: "" # Add your API key here
            - name: "SPACELIFT_PROMEX_API_KEY_SECRET"
              value: "" # Add your secret here
            - name: "SPACELIFT_PROMEX_LISTEN_ADDRESS"
              value: ":9953"
```

To use the example deployment, make sure you fill in the API endpoint, API Key ID and API Key
Secret, as explained in the comments. For a production deployment we would recommend making use of
Kubernetes secrets rather than embedding the API key values directly.

## Port Number

By default the exporter listens on port 9953. To change this use the `--listen-address` flag or the
`SPACELIFT_PROMEX_LISTEN_ADDRESS` environment variable:

```shell
spacelift-promex serve --listen-address ":9999" --api-endpoint "https://<account>.app.spacelift.io" --api-key-id "<API Key ID>" --api-key-secret "<API Key Secret>"
```

## Custom CA Certificate

If your Spacelift endpoint uses a certificate chain that is not trusted by system CAs, you can add
an extra trusted root certificate with `--ca-cert-path` or `SPACELIFT_PROMEX_CA_CERT_PATH`.
The exporter keeps system CAs and appends the certificate from the path you provide.

```shell
spacelift-promex serve --ca-cert-path "/certs/spacelift-ca.crt" --api-endpoint "https://<account>.app.spacelift.io" --api-key-id "<API Key ID>" --api-key-secret "<API Key Secret>"
```

```

## Version

To get version information, use the `--version` flag:

```shell
$ spacelift-promex --version
spacelift-promex version 0.0.1
```

## Scrape failures

Each scrape issues one GraphQL request per enabled collector (`publicworkerpool`, `workerpools`,
`usage`, `aggregates`), concurrently, within one `--scrape-timeout` deadline. Disable a collector with
`--no-collector.<name>` or `SPACELIFT_PROMEX_COLLECTOR_<NAME>=false`; a disabled collector issues
no request and emits no series.

By default, an error from any collector fails the whole scrape: `/metrics` returns HTTP 500 and
Prometheus records the target as down, so existing `up == 0` alerts keep working. The response body
names the collector that failed.

With `--partial-scrapes` (or `SPACELIFT_PROMEX_PARTIAL_SCRAPES=true`), `/metrics` returns HTTP 200
with the metrics of the collectors that succeeded, and the scrape fails only when no collector
succeeds. Alert on the individual collectors instead of, or as well as, the target:

```promql
spacelift_scrape_collector_success == 0
```

`spacelift_scrape_collector_supported == 0` means the deployment, tier or API key cannot supply that
collector's data: the field is gated for API keys, or the backend's schema lacks a field the
collector declares as one older backends may not have. One missing declared field makes the whole
collector report `supported` 0, even when its other fields exist. Any other missing field, such as a
typo, is a failure (`success` 0). Either way the API's message naming the field is in the
strict-mode HTTP 500 body and the exporter log. An unsupported collector is not a failure, and in
partial mode it does not fail the scrape while any collector still succeeds.

## Scrape interval and API load

The exporter does not poll on its own: every request to `/metrics` issues one GraphQL request per
enabled collector, live. API load is therefore set by your scrape configuration:

```text
requests per day, per collector = 86,400 / scrape interval in seconds x number of scrapers
```

A scraper is anything that requests `/metrics`: each replica of an HA Prometheus pair, a second
monitoring agent, or a probe pointed at `/metrics`. One exporter scraped every 15 seconds by an HA
pair issues 11,520 requests a day per collector; scraped every second, 172,800.

What each collector serves:

| Collector          | Serves                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `workerpools`      | Per-pool pending runs and worker counts                                                       |
| `publicworkerpool` | Pending runs, busy workers and parallelism on the public worker pool                          |
| `usage`            | Billing-period start, end and usage counters                                                  |
| `aggregates`       | Account-wide stack counts by state, resource drift, average stack size and run-duration stats |

Worker pool and stack-state series change as runs are queued, start and finish. How stale each
collector can be depends on what you alert or scale on: scrape it as often as its most
time-sensitive consumer needs, and no more often.

Recommendations:

- **Scrape every 30 to 60 seconds** unless an alert or autoscaler needs fresher data.
- **If you autoscale workers from these metrics** (for example with KEDA's Prometheus scaler), note
  that the scaler reads Prometheus, not the exporter, on its own schedule. When it reads, the
  newest sample can be up to one scrape interval old, so scraping faster lets it see newly queued
  runs sooner, at the cost of more API load: a tradeoff between sample freshness and load, not a
  free win. A KEDA `ScaledJob` reads every `pollingInterval`. A `ScaledObject` checks
  activation every `pollingInterval` but scales through the HPA, which polls every 15 seconds by
  default. With `useCachedMetrics`, those polls are answered from the value KEDA fetched at the last
  `pollingInterval`, so Prometheus is queried once per `pollingInterval`.
- **To scrape worker pools faster than the rest**, run a second exporter with only `workerpools`
  (and `publicworkerpool`, if you use the public pool) enabled and scrape that one fast, and disable
  them on the first one (`--no-collector.workerpools`, plus `--no-collector.publicworkerpool` if
  you moved it). Each series is then exported once, and each scrape of the fast job issues one
  request per collector enabled on it. Add a `job` matcher to scaler queries as well. A second scrape job against the same exporter does not
  help: every request to `/metrics` runs every enabled collector.
- **Point liveness and readiness probes at `/health`**, never at `/metrics`. `/health` answers
  without querying the Spacelift API.

## Collector cache TTL

`--collector.<name>.cache-ttl` (or `SPACELIFT_PROMEX_COLLECTOR_<NAME>_CACHE_TTL`) makes a collector
whose requests succeed query the API at most once per TTL, however often and by however many
scrapers the exporter is scraped. Scrapes in between are served the outcome of the last request,
and scrapes that arrive while a request is in flight wait for it instead of issuing one alongside
it. The first scrape after the TTL has passed issues a new request. The default of `0` queries on
every scrape, as the exporter always has. A negative TTL is rejected at startup, a TTL set for a
disabled collector is ignored with a warning, and the startup log shows the TTL next to each enabled
collector that has one. See [Scrape interval and API load](#scrape-interval-and-api-load) for how
the scrape configuration sets the request rate without a TTL.

The series of a cached collector can be up to one TTL old, so a TTL suits a collector whose data is
slow-moving and whose consumers tolerate staleness, such as `aggregates`. Leave it at `0` for a
collector that an alert or autoscaler reads for fresh values, such as `workerpools`.

A failed request is served for at most 30 seconds, or the TTL if that is shorter, and the next scrape
after that retries. A request cut short by the scrape's own `--scrape-timeout` is not cached at all.
An unsupported result is kept for the whole TTL. A served failure counts like any other: by default
it fails the whole scrape, and with `--partial-scrapes` it sets that collector's
`spacelift_scrape_collector_success` to `0`.

A cached collector reports what it served:

- `spacelift_scrape_collector_success` and `spacelift_scrape_collector_supported` describe the
  outcome served.
- `spacelift_scrape_collector_duration_seconds` reports the duration of the request that produced
  that outcome, not the near-zero time a scrape served from cache takes.
- `spacelift_scrape_collector_cache_age_seconds` reports how old the outcome is: `0` on the scrape
  that issued the request, otherwise the time since that request was issued. It is only emitted for
  collectors with a TTL, and it stays below the TTL, so alert on
  `spacelift_scrape_collector_success` rather than on the age.
